# Crop Image Prediction and Disease Recognition Mobile Application

This GitHub project showcases a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework, enabling deployment on both Android and iOS platforms. The primary functionality of this application is to predict the crop type from images captured by the device's camera or selected from the image gallery. Additionally, it provides disease recognition capabilities for crop images.

To achieve accurate predictions, this project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A pre-trained MobilenetV2 model is employed for transfer learning, which is then fine-tuned using a dataset of collected crop and disease images. The resulting TensorFlow model is converted into a TensorFlow Lite model for efficient deployment on mobile platforms.

By leveraging deep learning and transfer learning, this mobile application offers farmers and agricultural enthusiasts a convenient tool to identify crop types and detect potential diseases. The streamlined integration of image capture, prediction, and disease recognition enhances decision-making and contributes to improved crop management.
